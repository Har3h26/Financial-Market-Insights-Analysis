# Financial-Market-Insights-Analysis
# Overview
This project analyzes the stock data of S&P 500 companies to generate insights using key technical indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Averages (SMA/EMA). The analysis helps in identifying potential buy and sell signals based on market trends. The data is fetched from Yahoo Finance and visualized using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

# Features
RSI Calculation: A momentum oscillator used to measure the speed and change of price movements. RSI values range from 0 to 100, with overbought conditions considered above 70 and oversold conditions below 30.

# Moving Averages:

1) Simple Moving Average (SMA): The average of a stock's closing price over a specific time period, typically used to smooth out price data.
2) Exponential Moving Average (EMA): Gives more weight to recent prices, making it more responsive to recent price changes compared to SMA.
